                    <h4>Why is this project called "AngularJS"?</h4>
                    <p>Because HTML has Angular brackets and "ng" sounds like "Angular".</p>
                    <div class="divider divider-xl divider-dashed"></div>

                    <h4>What is the AngularJS versioning strategy?</h4>
                    <p>In Angular 1 we do not allow intentional breaking changes to appear in versions where only the "patch" number changes. For example between 1.3.12 and 1.3.13 there can be no breaking changes. We do allow breaking changes happen between "minor" number changes. For example between 1.3.15 and 1.4.0 there will be a number of breaking changes. We also allow breaking changes between beta releases of Angular. For example between 1.4.0-beta.4 and 1.4.0-beta.5 there may be breaking changes. </p>

                    <h4>Is AngularJS a templating system?</h4>
                    <p>At the highest level, Angular does look like just another templating system. But there is one important reason why the Angular templating system is different, that makes it very good fit for application development: bidirectional data binding. The template is compiled in the browser and the compilation step produces a live view. This means you, the developers, don't need to write code to constantly sync the view with the model and the model with the view as in other templating systems.</p>

                    <h4>Do I need to worry about security holes in AngularJS?</h4>
                    <p>Like any other technology, AngularJS is not impervious to attack. Angular does, however, provide built-in protection from basic security holes, including cross-site scripting and HTML injection attacks. AngularJS does round-trip escaping on all strings for you and even offers XSRF protection for server-side communication.</p>
                    <p>AngularJS was designed to be compatible with other security measures like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTPS (SSL/TLS) and server-side authentication and authorization that greatly reduce the possible attack vectors and we highly recommend their use.</p>

                    <h4>What browsers does Angular work with?</h4>
                    <p>We run our extensive test suite against the following browsers: the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Safari for iOs, as well as Internet Explorer versions 9-11. See Internet Explorer Compatibility for more details on supporting legacy IE browsers. </p>
                    <p>If a browser is untested, it doesn't mean it won't work; for example, older Android (2.3.x) is supported in the sense that we avoid the dot notation for reserved words as property names, but we don't actively test changes against it. You can also expect browsers to work that share a large part of their codebase with a browser we test, such as Opera > version 12 (uses the Blink engine), or the various Firefox derivatives.</p>

                    <h4>What's Angular's performance like?</h4>
                    <p>The startup time heavily depends on your network connection, state of the cache, browser used and available hardware, but typically we measure bootstrap time in tens or hundreds of milliseconds.</p>
                    <p>The runtime performance will vary depending on the number and complexity of bindings on the page as well as the speed of your backend (for apps that fetch data from the backend). For an illustration, we typically build snappy apps with hundreds or thousands of active bindings.</p>
                    <div class="divider divider-xl divider-dashed"></div>

                    <h4>Does Angular use the jQuery library?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, Angular can use jQuery if it's present in your app when the application is being bootstrapped. If jQuery is not present in your script path, Angular falls back to its own implementation of the subset of jQuery that we call jQLite.</p>
                    <p>Angular 1.3 only supports jQuery 2.1 or above. jQuery 1.7 and newer might work correctly with Angular but we don't guarantee that.</p>
